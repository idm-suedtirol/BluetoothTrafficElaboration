-- take the matches within each range
-- take the min and the max value of percorrenza within each range
-- loop from min to max value of percorrenza with 5 seconds step
-- for each step count the number of values between step and step + 30 seconds
-- as mode for the range take the step with greater count and when more have the same value then the lower value
